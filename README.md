# mono-pi
C# Mono Library for various single board computers such as the RaspberryPi

# Aim
The aim of this project is to create a simple and clean class library for 
accessing various Pi functionality from mono. Ideally the library will have no
third party dependencies.

The library will provide access to GPIO pins and add supporting logic for basic
bit banging operations such as I2C and shift registers.
